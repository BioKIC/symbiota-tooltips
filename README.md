# symbiota-tooltips

## An open API to help document Symbiota tools and terms

This repository contains API endpoints where one can fetch short explanations about [Symbiota]() pages or terms in a portal.
The short explanations provided here (along with optional links when available) are integrated with [Symbiota Light]() code, so that tooltips are available dynamically, on demand in pages and terms throughout the interface.
Endpoints include language tags, so that the content can be delivered in the idiom used by the interface.
In the future this repository will interact with [Symbiota Docs](), so that longer documents can be linked in the tooltips as well.
